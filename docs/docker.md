# FigWatch — Docker / Server Deployment

FigWatch runs as a headless webhook server — no macOS required. Rather than polling Figma on a timer, it receives events from Figma in real time and processes them immediately.

## What you'll need

Setup involves two roles that are often different people — a **Figma admin** who can generate tokens and register webhooks, and a **server operator** who runs Docker. Collect everything below before starting.

### From your Figma admin

| What | Where to get it | Used for |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Figma Personal Access Token** | Figma → Settings → Security → [Personal access tokens](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/8085703771159-Manage-personal-access-tokens) | Authenticating API requests |
| **Figma team ID** | From your team URL: `figma.com/files/team/`**`1234567890`**`/…` — the number after `/team/` | Registering the webhook |

> The Figma account providing the token must be on a **Professional or Organisation plan** — Figma webhooks are not available on Starter (free) accounts.

### AI provider key — choose one

| Provider | Where to get it | Cost |
|----------|----------------|------|
| **Google AI (Gemini)** — recommended | [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) | Free tier available |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) | Paid |

### From your server operator

| What | Notes |
|------|-------|
| **Server URL** | A publicly accessible HTTPS URL where Figma can send events. Use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for local testing. |
| **Webhook passcode** | Any secret string you choose — used to verify that webhook events genuinely come from Figma. |

---

## How it works

Figma sends a `FILE_COMMENT` webhook event to your server whenever a comment is posted in your team. FigWatch checks whether the comment contains a trigger word (`@ux`, `@tone`, etc.), fetches the frame data from Figma, runs the AI audit, and posts the result as a reply — all within the same comment thread.

## Quick start

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your values. Minimum required:

```env
FIGMA_PAT=figd_your_token_here
FIGWATCH_WEBHOOK_PASSCODE=choose-a-secret-passphrase
FIGWATCH_TEAM_ID=1234567890
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key_here
```

### 2. Start the server

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The server listens on port `8080` and exposes two endpoints:
- `POST /webhook` — receives Figma webhook events
- `GET /health` — returns `ok` (used by Docker healthcheck)

### 3. Expose the server to the internet

Figma's servers need to be able to reach your endpoint over HTTPS.

**Production:** point your domain at the server, terminate TLS with a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, etc.).

**Local development:** use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com):

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

This gives you a URL like `https://your-subdomain.ngrok-free.app`. Copy it — you need it in the next step.

### 4. Register the webhook with Figma

Run this curl command once. It reads `FIGMA_PAT`, `FIGWATCH_WEBHOOK_PASSCODE`, and `FIGWATCH_TEAM_ID` from your `.env` — just replace `YOUR_HOST`:

```bash
source .env

curl -X POST https://api.figma.com/v2/webhooks \
  -H "X-Figma-Token: $FIGMA_PAT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"event_type\": \"FILE_COMMENT\",
    \"team_id\": \"$FIGWATCH_TEAM_ID\",
    \"endpoint\": \"https://YOUR_HOST/webhook\",
    \"passcode\": \"$FIGWATCH_WEBHOOK_PASSCODE\"
  }"
```

For full webhook API details, see the [Figma Webhooks documentation](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#webhooks_v2).

Figma will immediately send a `PING` event to verify the endpoint is reachable. Check your logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

You should see:

```
🏓 ping received
```

If you see a 403 instead, the passcode in the request doesn't match `FIGWATCH_WEBHOOK_PASSCODE` in your `.env`.

## Using FigWatch

Pin a comment containing a trigger word to a frame in Figma:

1. Press **C** to activate the comment tool
2. **Click directly on a frame** — the frame should highlight before you click
3. Type `@ux` (or `@tone`) and post the comment

> **The comment must be pinned to a frame.** Floating canvas comments have no node ID and will be skipped. The cursor must be over a specific frame when you click, not on empty canvas.

Within seconds you should see the audit appear as a reply in the same thread.

## Environment variables

All variables are documented in [`.env.example`](../.env.example) with sensible defaults. The tables below group them by function.

### Required

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `FIGMA_PAT` | Figma Personal Access Token |
| `FIGWATCH_WEBHOOK_PASSCODE` | Secret passphrase set when registering the webhook |
| `FIGWATCH_TEAM_ID` | Figma team ID — needed for webhook registration and enables webhook health monitoring |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google AI API key — required when `FIGWATCH_MODEL` starts with `gemini` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic API key — required when `FIGWATCH_MODEL` is `sonnet`, `opus`, or `haiku` |

> You need at least one AI provider key. Both can be set — the one used depends on `FIGWATCH_MODEL`.

### Core

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FIGWATCH_MODEL` | `gemini-flash` | `gemini-flash`, `gemini-flash-lite`, `sonnet`, `opus`, or `haiku` |
| `FIGWATCH_FILES` | — | Comma-separated Figma file URLs or keys. Unset = all team files |
| `FIGWATCH_LOCALE` | `uk` | Locale for tone audits: `uk`, `de`, `fr`, `nl`, `benelux` |
| `FIGWATCH_PORT` | `8080` | Port to listen on |
| `FIGWATCH_WORKERS` | `4` | Concurrent skill executions |
| `FIGWATCH_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | Retry attempts per audit (backoff: 30s, 2m, 5m) |

### Rate limiting

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FIGWATCH_GEMINI_RPM` | `15` | Gemini requests-per-minute cap. Workers block locally when the limit is reached. `0` to disable. |
| `FIGWATCH_ANTHROPIC_RPM` | `5` | Anthropic requests-per-minute cap. `0` to disable. |
| `FIGWATCH_QUEUE_UPDATE_RPM` | `5` | Live queue-position ack updates per minute. `0` to disable — acks stay at their initial position until picked up. |

### Logging

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FIGWATCH_LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, or `ERROR` |
| `FIGWATCH_LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | `text` (human-readable, ANSI colors in TTY) or `json` (one object per line, for Loki/Datadog) |

### Monitoring and observability

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | — | OpenTelemetry collector endpoint (e.g. `http://otel-collector:4317`). Metrics disabled when unset. |
| `FIGWATCH_MONITOR_TICK` | `60` | Seconds between checking the next file in the rotation |
| `FIGWATCH_MONITOR_GRACE` | `60` | Seconds before flagging a comment as a missed webhook |
| `FIGWATCH_MONITOR_FILE_REFRESH` | `3600` | Seconds between re-enumerating team files |
| `FIGWATCH_MONITOR_RPM` | `5` | Figma API req/min budget for the monitor |

## Custom skills

Mount a directory of custom skill files into the container:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (already configured)
volumes:
  - ./custom-skills:/app/custom-skills
```

Place `.md` skill files in `./custom-skills/` on the host. FigWatch registers each file as a trigger based on its filename — `a11y.md` becomes `@a11y`, `brand.md` becomes `@brand`. No additional configuration required.

## Viewing logs

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

A healthy run looks like this:

```
2026-04-14 19:19:06 INFO  __main__     file=abc123 comment=1234567 📥 webhook received
2026-04-14 19:19:06 INFO  __main__     audit=a3f9e2d1 trigger=@ux node=176:24454 file=abc123 user=alice 💬 trigger matched

```

### Correlating log lines for a single audit

Every log line produced while processing a comment carries the same `audit=XXXXXXXX` ID. To see the full lifecycle for one audit in [Dozzle](https://dozzle.dev) or `docker compose logs`, search for that audit ID:

```bash
docker compose logs figwatch | grep 'audit=a3f9e2d1'
```

The same works for `trigger=@ux`, `node=176:24454`, or `file=abc123` if you want to filter by other dimensions.

## Webhook health monitoring

Figma webhooks can be unreliable — sometimes a comment is created but the webhook never fires. FigWatch detects these missed webhooks by periodically checking the Figma comments API and comparing against what arrived via webhook.

Since `FIGWATCH_TEAM_ID` is already set (required for webhook registration), monitoring is enabled automatically. On startup, FigWatch discovers all files in your team via the Figma API, then rotates through them one per tick (default 60 seconds). For each file it fetches recent comments and checks whether they were delivered via webhook. Missed comments are logged as warnings:

```
2026-04-17 10:30:12 WARNING monitor  monitor: missed webhook detected file=abc123 comment_id=9876543 comment_age_seconds=95
```

The file list is refreshed hourly so new files are picked up automatically.

### Rate limiting

The monitor uses a dedicated rate limiter (default 5 req/min) so it doesn't compete with audit operations for the shared Figma API budget. With 5 req/min and a 60-second tick, the monitor uses roughly 1 request per tick for comment checks, plus a small burst when enumerating team files on startup and hourly refresh.

### OpenTelemetry metrics

Set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` to export metrics to any OTel-compatible collector:

```env
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://otel-collector:4317
```

Key metrics:

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `figwatch.webhook.received_total` | Counter | Webhook events received, by `event_type` |
| `figwatch.webhook.missed_total` | Counter | Comments found in Figma but never received via webhook |
| `figwatch.webhook.last_received_seconds` | Gauge | Unix timestamp of last webhook event |
| `figwatch.monitor.files_tracked` | Gauge | Number of files in monitoring rotation |
| `figwatch.audit.duration_seconds` | Histogram | End-to-end audit time |
| `figwatch.audit.total` | Counter | Audits completed, by `status` |
| `figwatch.queue.depth` | UpDownCounter | Current queue depth |

Metrics are disabled (zero overhead) when `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is not set. The monitor can run without OTel — it still logs missed webhooks as warnings.

## Troubleshooting

**`skip: no node_id`**
The comment was not pinned to a frame. In Figma, press C, hover over a frame until it highlights, then click and post your trigger comment. Floating canvas comments have no associated node.

**`skip: no trigger`**
The comment text doesn't contain a recognised trigger word. The server logs show which triggers are active at startup.

**`skip: file not in allowlist`**
`FIGWATCH_FILES` is set and the comment came from a different file. Either add the file to the allowlist or clear `FIGWATCH_FILES` to handle all team files.

**`skip: already processed`**
Figma retries webhook delivery if your server doesn't respond quickly enough. FigWatch deduplicates by comment ID, so this is harmless.

**`403 Forbidden` on webhook delivery**
The passcode in the registered webhook doesn't match `FIGWATCH_WEBHOOK_PASSCODE`. Re-register the webhook (see below) with the correct passcode.

**Gemini 429 — quota exceeded**
The free tier has a token-per-minute limit. FigWatch retries once after the suggested delay. If you hit this regularly, consider upgrading to a paid Google AI tier or switching to `FIGWATCH_MODEL=sonnet` with an Anthropic key.

**No webhook events arriving**
- Check that your endpoint is publicly reachable over HTTPS — Figma requires HTTPS
- Verify the webhook is registered: `curl https://api.figma.com/v2/teams/$FIGWATCH_TEAM_ID/webhooks -H "X-Figma-Token: $FIGMA_PAT"`
- The PAT used to register the webhook must belong to an account that has access to the team on a paid plan
- If using ngrok, make sure the tunnel is still running — free ngrok URLs expire on restart

**Audit takes a long time / times out**
- Check `FIGWATCH_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` to see where time is spent
- Large frames produce big screenshots — the progressive fallback may need multiple attempts
- Gemini free tier has a tokens-per-minute limit that can cause queuing under load

**Container exits immediately**
- Check logs: `docker compose logs figwatch`
- Most common cause: missing required env vars (`FIGMA_PAT`, `FIGWATCH_WEBHOOK_PASSCODE`, `FIGWATCH_TEAM_ID`, AI key)

## Example production deployment

[figwatch-olivia](https://github.com/simonpforster/figwatch-olivia) is a complete deployment stack that adds:

- **Cloudflare Tunnel** — HTTPS ingress without a reverse proxy or public IP
- **OpenTelemetry Collector** — receives metrics from FigWatch and forwards to Prometheus
- **Prometheus** — stores metrics with 30-day retention
- **Grafana** — dashboards for audit duration, queue depth, and webhook reliability

Clone it as a starting point for your own production setup.

## Managing webhooks

List your registered webhooks:

```bash
curl https://api.figma.com/v2/teams/$FIGWATCH_TEAM_ID/webhooks \
  -H "X-Figma-Token: $FIGMA_PAT"
```

Delete a webhook (use the `id` from the list response):

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.figma.com/v2/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID \
  -H "X-Figma-Token: $FIGMA_PAT"
```

## Stopping

```bash
docker compose down
```
