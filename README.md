# FigWatch

A macOS menu bar app that watches your Figma files and responds to `@tone` and `@ux` comments with AI-powered audits — powered by Claude Code.

Drop a comment like `@tone` or `@ux` on any frame in Figma, and FigWatch replies with a detailed audit directly in the comment thread.

## Features

- **@tone** — Tone of Voice audit against locale-specific guidelines (UK, DE, FR, NL, Benelux). Flags unnatural copy, hype language, incorrect currency formatting, punctuation issues, and glossary violations. Suggests fixes inline.
- **@ux** — Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics evaluation. Takes a screenshot and reads the node tree of the target frame, then evaluates all 10 heuristics with severity scores and specific recommendations.
- **Auto-detect open Figma files** via Chrome DevTools Protocol — automatically relaunches Figma with CDP enabled if needed, so there's nothing to configure.
- **Immediate acknowledgment** — posts a "working on it" reply while Claude processes the audit.
- **Locale selector** — switch between UK, DE, FR, NL, and Benelux from the menu bar dropdown.
- **Auto-restart** — if the watcher crashes, FigWatch restarts it automatically.
- **macOS notifications** — get notified when audits are posted.
- **Recent files** — quickly reconnect to previously watched files.

## Install

**One-line install** (recommended):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/livisliving/FigWatch/main/install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest release, installs `FigWatch.app` to `/Applications`, clears the Gatekeeper quarantine, and launches it. After that, all future updates can be done in-app via **Settings → Check for Updates → Install & Restart**.

**Manual install:**

1. Download **FigWatch.zip** from the [latest release](https://github.com/livisliving/FigWatch/releases)
2. Unzip and drag `FigWatch.app` to **Applications**
3. First launch: **right-click → Open** (one-time Gatekeeper bypass)
4. Follow the onboarding to set up Claude Code and your Figma token

## Requirements

- macOS 13+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/getting-started)
- Figma Personal Access Token
- Figma Desktop (recommended, for file detection + screenshots)

## How it works

1. Open a file in Figma Desktop
2. Click the FigWatch icon in your menu bar and select the file
3. Leave a comment on any frame:
   - `@tone` — runs a Tone of Voice audit for the selected locale
   - `@tone de` — runs a ToV audit using German guidelines (overrides the locale selector)
   - `@ux` — runs a UX heuristic evaluation with screenshot analysis
4. FigWatch polls for new comments every 30 seconds, picks up the trigger, and posts the audit as a reply

## Supported locales

| Locale | Flag | Guidelines |
|--------|------|------------|
| UK | GB | English — default |
| DE | DE | German — formal (Sie), precise, no hype |
| FR | FR | French — elegant, warm (vous), guillemets |
| NL | NL | Dutch — direct, plain-speaking (je/jij) |
| Benelux | EU | Belgian Dutch + Belgian French |

## Configuration

FigWatch stores its config in `~/.figwatch/`:

- `config.json` — Figma PAT and settings
- `recent-watches.json` — recently watched files
- `.processed-comments.json` — tracks which comments have been handled

## What's new in v1.1.5

- **Fix "Claude not installed" false positive** — the claude CLI path is now re-resolved on every dependency check instead of being cached once at launch. If you install Claude Code after starting FigWatch (or if claude lives in a non-standard location like `~/.local/bin`, `~/.volta/bin`, `~/.bun/bin`, etc.), FigWatch will now pick it up automatically. Falls back to searching an augmented PATH with `shutil.which` if none of the common paths match.
- **Onboarding checklist stays put until setup is actually done** — `claude auth status` exits 0 even when you're not signed in, so FigWatch was incorrectly marking Claude Login as complete and hiding the checklist after a single view. It now parses the JSON `loggedIn` field, so the three required steps (Claude Code, Claude Login, Figma Token) persist in the onboarding panel until they're genuinely finished.
- **Fix `@ux` hanging and returning "Unable to generate evaluation"** — Claude Code 2.1.72 needs `--add-dir` in addition to `--allowedTools Read` to actually read files outside the CWD. Without it, Claude would hit an interactive permission prompt for the `/tmp/figwatch-*` screenshot and node-tree files and block until the 120-second timeout killed it. FigWatch now passes `--add-dir /tmp` so the audit runs through cleanly.
- **Surface Figma API errors instead of "Could not locate the commented frame"** — `_figma_get` now retries once on 429 (honoring `Retry-After`) and records the real HTTP error. When frame resolution fails, the reply now says "rate limited, try again in a minute" or "token missing file_content:read scope" instead of a generic not-found message.
- **Strip stale handler `.pyc` from `lib/python39.zip`** — py2app was bundling compiled `handlers/*.pyc` files that Python's import machinery preferred over the loose `.py` files on disk. Any bug fix to a handler shipped after the initial build was silently ignored until the `.pyc` got regenerated. These entries are now removed from the shipped zip, so handler fixes take effect immediately.

## What's new in v1.1.4

- **Real in-app auto-update** — clicking "Check for Updates" now offers an **Install & Restart** button that downloads the new build, swaps `/Applications/FigWatch.app` in place, clears Gatekeeper quarantine, and relaunches FigWatch. No more manual drag-to-Applications on every release.

## What's new in v1.1.3

- **Fix "Unable to generate audit" on Apple Silicon** — `@tone` and `@ux` handlers now pass an augmented `PATH` to the `claude` subprocess so it can find `node` in `/opt/homebrew/bin`. Previously, macOS gave .app bundles a minimal PATH, so Claude Code couldn't locate its Node.js runtime when spawned from FigWatch and died silently.
- **Surface claude errors in audits** — when an audit fails, the reply now includes the actual stderr from `claude` instead of a bare "Unable to generate audit." line, so failures are self-diagnosing.

## What's new in v1.1.2

- **Check for Updates** — new button in the Settings panel that checks the latest release on GitHub and opens the release page when an update is available.
- **Watch from URL** — paste a Figma file link directly when auto-detect can't see your file. Recent Figma Desktop builds (v126+) no longer expose the remote-debugging port, which broke auto-detect for some users; this gives you a manual path that always works.
- **Fixed Figma relaunch loop** — FigWatch will no longer quit and reopen Figma every 30 seconds when CDP isn't reachable. Auto-relaunch is now one-shot per session.
- Fixed the Disconnect button overlapping long file names in the header.
- Reply language setting — `@tone` and `@ux` can now reply in Chinese (简体中文) in addition to the source locale.
- Refreshed AI model labels (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku) — version numbers dropped in the settings dropdown.

## What's new in v1.1.1

- **Settings panel** — new gear icon in the footer opens a settings dialog with Figma token management and AI model switching (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku). Model choice is persisted and auto-restarts the watcher.
- **Auto-CDP** — FigWatch now auto-relaunches Figma Desktop with CDP debugging enabled if it detects Figma is running without it — no manual `--remote-debugging-port=9222` flag needed.
- `@ux` audits now reply as plain-text Figma comments (like `@tone`), instead of generating a separate `.md` report file.

## What's new in v1.1.0

- Watcher rewritten in pure Python (no Node.js dependency)
- App bundle shrunk from 129MB to 24MB (81% smaller)
- Onboarding: Claude Login check, better error feedback
- macOS notifications on audit completion and token validation
- Empty file list shows guidance
